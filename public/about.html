<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born in a smalll town in South-Africa called Barkley-West in the year 1996 on the 26th of February.
  we changed towns a couple of times but always ended up in the Northern-Cape or Freestate.
I'm sure you are not here to hear my life story.
</p>

<p>Much of my information is available in my CV
<p>The easiest thing to do in life is blaming other people for your short comings is what I believe.
  Hence I started my journey in the world of coding at the age of 30.
  Best thing you can do is to start,so I started.
  <p>My portfolio you will be viewing is the result of it.</p>
