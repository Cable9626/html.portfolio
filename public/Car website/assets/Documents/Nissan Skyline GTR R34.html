<h3>Engine & Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Engine: 2.6L twin-turbo inline-6 (RB26DETT)</li>
<li>Official power: 276 hp (because of Japan’s “gentlemen’s agreement”)</li>

<li>0–60 mph: ~4.9 seconds</li>
<li>Top speed: Electronically limited to 155 mph (easily removable)</li>
</ul>
<p>The RB26 is famous for being insanely overbuilt, which is why people push it to 600, 800, even 1,000+ hp with the right mods.</p>

<h3>Tech That Was Way Ahead of Its Time</h3>
<ul>
<li>ATTESA E-TS AWD system – rear-wheel drive most of the time, sends power to the front when needed</li>
<li>Super-HICAS – rear-wheel steering for better cornering</li>
<li>Multi-Function Display (MFD) – showed boost, G-forces, lap times, oil temp, etc. (very futuristic in the late ’90s)</li>
</ul>
