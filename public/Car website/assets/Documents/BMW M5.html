  This car was a bold departure — BMW took F1-inspired tech (individual throttle bodies, high compression, ion-sensing ignition) and put it in a four-door executive sedan. 
  The result? An addictive high-revving howl that's still considered one of the greatest engine notes in automotive history.

<p>
  The exterior design (Chris Bangle era) was polarizing when new, but it has aged extremely well — aggressive yet elegant, especially in black, silver, or Interlagos Blue.
