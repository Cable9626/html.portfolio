<h1>2011 Mercedes‑Benz C63 AMG BLACK SERIES W204 (2011-2013)</h1>
<hr>
<p>The Mercedes‑Benz C63 AMG Black Series (W204) is one of the most extreme and highly sought‑after performance cars AMG ever made — a race‑bred C‑Class that’s also road‑legal and rare.</p>
<h3>What It Is</h3>
<hr>
<p>The Black Series is the ultimate high‑performance version of the W204‑generation C63 AMG, produced between 2011 and 2013. It was built by Mercedes‑AMG’s Performance Studio as a low‑volume, track‑focused model based on the C63 AMG Coupé.</p>
<h3>Engine & Perfomance</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Engine: 6.2‑litre naturally aspirated V8 (M156), hand‑built and tuned for maximum performance.</li>
<li>Power: ~380 kW (≈ 517 PS / ≈ 510 hp) and 620 Nm torque.</li>
<li>Transmission: 7‑speed AMG Speedshift MCT automatic, sending power to the rear wheels.</li>
<li>Acceleration: ~0–100 km/h in around 4.2 seconds.</li>
<li>Top Speed: Electronically limited to about 300 km/h (186 mph).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chassis & Handling</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Aggressive bodywork with flared wheel arches, larger air intakes, and a DTM‑inspired stance.</li>
<li>Aerodynamic enhancements, including optional carbon fibre splitters and wings.</li>
<li>Inside you’ll find lightweight sport seats (often 2‑seat layout), a sport steering wheel, red accents and Alcantara trim — less luxury‑oriented and more performance‑centric than regular C63 interiors.</li>
</ul>
